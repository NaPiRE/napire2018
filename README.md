Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering ([NaPiRE](http://napire.org/#/home)) constitutes a globally distributed family of surveys on Requirements Engineering (RE) practices and problems, initiated by Daniel Méndez and Stefan Wagner in 2012. It is nowadays conducted by an internationally distributed alliance of software engineering researchers with the goal to help the research community getting a better understanding of general industrial trends in Requirements Engineering (RE) and problems faced therein. NaPiRE is an academic (non-profit and open) endeavour which aims at establishing the first holistic theory on industrial practices and problems in RE.

This repository contains all the material from the 2018 Edition of the NaPiRE Survey:

- [Organisation](https://github.com/NaPiRE/napire2018/tree/master/Organisation): Contains material from the data collection (e.g. invitation text messages or the project export from the survey tool).
- [data](https://github.com/NaPiRE/napire2018/tree/master/data): Contains all the raw data as exported from the survey tool. The file napire_truth.csv contains the cleaned data set.
- [documentation](https://github.com/NaPiRE/napire2018/tree/master/documentation): Contains the codebook and documentation material supporting the data analysis process (e.g. coding instructions).
- [notebooks](https://github.com/NaPiRE/napire2018/tree/master/notebooks): Contains all Jupyter notebooks as used in the data analysis.
- [notebooks_html](https://github.com/NaPiRE/napire2018/tree/master/notebooks_html): HTML exports of selected notebooks.

**Note:** The repository is private as long as the data analysis as well as the further collaborations based on the NaPiRE data are ongoing and will be made public with an open data export to Zenodo.
