1969;As an experienced consultant, I have the luxury of being able to choose my projects carefully.  When I start a project I clearly state what I believe to be the minimum level of requirements engineering and specification.  If the customer exceeds my expectations, no problem.  If it does not, I work hard to convince them to improve their requirements elicitation processes and I put a lot of energy into helping them.  If after a reasonable period (usually a few months) they haven't made movement in a positive direction, I leave the project.  In my experience, the key cause of project failure is poorly defined requirements.  I no longer  need the experience  so I do not stay with projects that have a low probability of success.;stakeholderInvolvement;people
