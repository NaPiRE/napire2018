258;1) It takes Long time before we can start to develop and see prototypes. Whenever we discuss Requirements, new ideas Pop up. So we never are able to get a Quote and have development start. Also getting prototypes is difficult cause we Need to place new orders for every Change. Therefore we try to specify much upfront which brings us back to beginning - we don't get ready to go cause we have new ideas.  2) Last Versions we got back were rather Buggy. And then discussions started on if the Requirements are good enough, whether we should Hand out test cases, when to find time to write test cases. And also why things were not working any longer which used to work and how we can put that in Requirements, that  the System functionality as is must be kept working ...  3) We have a tool  break. Internally we specify in System A. But the external developer can not (or only very painfully) Access that System. So we have a self built Integration to System B. This should copy the Requirements and Bugs form A to B. But it does it only partially (attachments for Requirements are not carried over), IDs are randomly created in B so order of requirements and Logical structure gets lost. For Bugs attachments are handed over, but on the back-Syncronisation from B to A Images in the descriptions are lost...  ;processInadequate;process
