30;Since systems we developed face the natural environment, several unexpected events occur.  We should establish requirements analysis techniques to deal with requirements related to uncertain environment.

93;struggle: complex processes, not uniform. The business wants ALL done in the system, which makes it unflexible and hard to maintain. Sometimes it is wise to consider if you really NEED to do certain steps in the system. 
114;use case:   different HW component but same requirement   how shall a requirement document look like in case of having different HW components which have the same requirements.  currently we are copying/sharing the requirements so each requirement can be linked to a certain test case for each HW component.  In case of changes, we have to change on many places. But in case we have only one requirement for all HW components, we cannot garanty that each HW component has tested the requirement.
115;Help to spread the knowledge - especially amongst Managers.  If this could be achieved, most of our problems would be non-existing.
129;None
141;Requirements gathering with virtual teams in short duration (4 hours or less) working sessions is not always efficient. Keeping participants focused is not always possible, leading to many  restarts  during a session while some key participants are multi-tasking.
144;No
160;yes, the tooling aspect. it's often a problem using different tools in RE process from the customers need to implementation task and test cases. #traceability  We do everything within JIRA, but the acceptance by our customers is difficult.
165;RE is not only a SW engineering concern. I guess that all engineering domains may benefit of RE (from civil engineering, to mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, etc.).  The interdisciplinary is growing and the various trades shall share a same (similar?) approach to RE and it is not clear yet.  RE needs to grow in maturity.
167;While competence and skills are more important, the right tools are crucial in scaling. This survey does not touch on this issue at all.
170;no

199;More of a question to the community:  How can we convince stakeholders that the lack of proper requirements is costly and dangerous.  This is the fundamental problem I see.

208;no
210;We do not have a formal process
213;I have noticed that when meets researcher and a practitioner in some experience exchange, for example in conference, there are lot of old topic from practitioners and new topics from researchers. And during the discussions there comes a misunderstanding. In the science field we are tended to create new innovations and new ideas for new situations, but we forgot to validate the previous ideas in practice. I'm a researcher also and a practitioner in the same time. And I realize that many RE methods, techniques etc isn't implemented fully in practice. And time after time practitioners came back and realize that the old method have some unanswered questions and the implementation is to complex.   In the result I came to question - do we need to much new innovations? Maybe we need to focus on existing methods and improve them. Maybe we need to make an inventory and think simpler. We need to encourage the practice, we need to improve productivity and support future work. RE practical field are strongly behind the science.    Sorry for my English.  I'm working on such topic like Continuous Requirements Engineering and one of my focus points are used tools and possibility to improve requirements use in future and requirements inheritance. If You are interested in collaboration, I will be glad to cooperate. 
217;none
230;An interesting fact is that in my experience there is no an official Requirements Engineer. Rather, the job of creating requirements is usually given to someone who has years of experience in the project's field. Hence, it would be interesting to know (in future surveys), how the person taking the survey gained his or her experience in the  Requirement Engineering field.
259;No.
291;When a system needs to change/to be replaced often the current situation (IST) is not clear. Every project (change) needs (extra) time to find out what the current situation is. Better is to maintain the knowledge of the current situation. So each change needs a kind of after-care to maintain it.

729;Need for a team of Business Analysts with skills to detect different types of stakeholders, in order to address them in the best way (there are people who feel more comfortable showing what they do, others do not have problems to summarize and explain what they need and wish, while others feel uncomfortable exposing against others). It should be able to design a plan of requirements elicitation tailored to each case. I clarify that the project was in a food industry and those involved in the survey of requirements from the counterpart were direct users, which in some cases were business executives, and other plant personnel, so it is important to know the different profiles and the ability to communicate at all levels (operators, supervisors, managers). We find it very positive rely on teams with staff with specific knowledge of the business area for which software is being developed. We consider very positive the participation of  Security, Architecture and Testing personnel from the beginning of the project, which helps to define requirements that would otherwise arise in advanced stages, and could lead to rework.
754;No
758;I also work as a researcher and I think the user story driven approach should be used in some of our project planning even for research.

795;We don't ever work out the cost of implementing a requirement vs. the value it adds. This means at times we spend far more implementing something than we could ever make back .In one memorable case we spent $800k to satisfy one part of an acknowledged one-off requirement for a contract of $250k.
818;no
831;No
839;No.
868;I believe that the documentation of the requirements is interesting for development but not for maintenance (both corrective and evolutionary). The cost to keep the documentaiton up-to-date is very high. I'm trying to create documentation that is tailored to maintenance needs and stays updated even after encoding.

896;"Sure, works with app development for virtual reality and smartwatch. Much that is reported in the questionnaire ... is for information systems. In two months we already have products in the store ... we do not use even half of the engineering related with requirements. Our ""requirements analyst"" is often a researcher, an guy with experience in usability or a UX guy."
900;Deficiency in the use of new techniques that aid in the communication between the client and the technical team
901;no
909;"There is always the dilemma of the level of granularity that should be considered in the projects. Should we spend project time documenting, or should we not document enough to keep project information as an asset of the company? I have observed that the concept of Agile has been misapplied in the projects and with that, many projects and companies have abdicated requirements engineering to respond quickly to clients / market. Thus, developing software has been treated as a commodity, which makes me very worried. Profiles that think only of technological solutions are increasingly common. With this, they are considered more important the ""how"" than ""what"" should be implemented."

In this way, you must have a plan, pilots and time for this transition, the organizations need to experiment and evolve gradually, safely, reducing resistance and conflicts between residual rules and standards still existing from the experiences with CMMI and MPS-Br to a more light model ... but it is happening as it should be.

1220;In the government and private sector the biggest development problem is the behavior of certain customer stakeholders will always exist but after our years of experience no longer present obstacles.
1229;I think the engineer who raises the requirements in agile development, must have new skills and tools that allow abstracting not only what the customer needs but present it in an easier way and make it understandable for the whole team. The value of a user story three lines is usually higher than a document of 10 pages which is not read.

1753;Maybe that our requirements tend to change a lot. This does not mean that we have a moving target, but rather that the reality where our systems work changes all the time and we need to keep up. I.e. changing requirements needs to be handled in a good way - both documentation, managing their impact and communicating to stakeholders. Rigid requirements are usually easier since they tend to stay the same form for a long time.    For instance: A requirement for the break pedal of a car is quite stable, but for the infotainment station in the same car the requirements may change each update/service for the car.

1969;While I see many developers scrimp on RE processes, I find that it is management that fails mostly here.  Non-technical management are often unwilling to take advice from a person with technical experience when it comes to process, and that typically leads to project failure.  I mentioned in previous questions that I have no problem leaving projects after a few months.  I see no point in spending my time on such projects.
