84,"we document detailed requirements through the analysis of the existing business logic implemented in the old system - component by component, already more than 1,5 year "
147,"We document high-level requirements, PMO expects this to be enough information and then we have to refine them during development, sometimes delaying the delivery of an increment."
213,"Actualy we have bouth first two point, we create detailed requirementes and we detalaize and improve them in the process"
249,I apply every technique that I know to decompose the problem state until I can visualize the requirements. 
258,"mix of epics for for the next year and detail them for the next 2 months. Challenge is, that we have an external company developing. So far we did plans for a year. So we needed to know what we wanted to do next year."
332,"Depends on the risk and the complexity, simple straightforward aspects high level, sw agile, complex aspect with lots of detail if needed"
377,"We deliver both Agile and Traditional Waterfall projects, with capturing of Epics and User Stories for the former, and detailed fully-fledged requirements for the latter"
479,We mix high-level requirements and detailed requirements depending of the pre-system-architecture and the ISO 26262 FTA-Events.
809,Documented at the end of the project
830,We in ital document high level business requirements (based on the customer provided business capability statements) and then refined these into detailed requirements in a single analysis phase.
839,"We take a hybrid approach between high-level and no documentation at the outset, but refine documents during the development/pilot phase of the project"
896,Through UX and a brief presentation
1194,Brief user stories and acceptance criteria
1200,we briefly document core requirements early in the project
1321,"As requirements are specific not much level of granularity is needed, as the project is ongoing the project manager documents requirements when a customer requests it"
1402,"For  known  architectural elements we document detailed requirements at the beginning of the project, the remainder are refined as required over time"
1403,depending on the complexity of the project; all of the above mentioned approaches
1428,It's kind of a cross-over of point 1/2 in this question. We're bound to the EN62304 requiring quite complete documentation of requirements at all phases of the project.
1542,"We document high-level requirements usually starting the quarter, the the PO refines them close to the sprint where they will be tackled and hey are re-refined with the team during planning or development"
1633,"the company uses very detailed specification documents, which are written in parallel to development"
1665,Documented during execution/deploy
1690,"It is a very dynamic System with changing requirements, we document per module and and refine in each iteration"
1742,"We document semi detailed requirements at beginning of the project and refine them to detailed requirements when needed (for instance, we document epics and refine them to user stories for the sprints)."
1744,Short briefing in a handover meeting
1753,We continously update our requirements in each sprint and if needed during the sprint. The documentation and refinement of the requirements are made by me but they are then reviewed and accepted by the customer.
1755,Document at high level only
1928,Not sure for other team. In my team it doesn't really apply as it is mainly product maintenance
