Dear colleagues,

We are launching the 3rd replication of our bi-yearly conducted survey on Requirements Engineering (RE) to explore trends in industrial practices and problems in RE. The survey forms part of the large-scale Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering (NaPiRE) initiative [1], started in 2012, and it is conducted by an internationally distributed alliance of software engineering researchers with the goals to 

(1) help the research community getting a better understanding of general industrial trends in Requirements Engineering (RE) and problems faced therein and, thus, strengthen the practical relevance of research outcomes.
(2) help practitioners assessing their current RE situation in context of overall trends.

We would like to cordially invite practitioners to participate in this survey, and researchers to further distribute the invitation.

Most important facts in a nutshell:
* This survey is conducted worldwide.
* We pose a set of questions structured according to the categories:
   -- General information about the respondent and her project context,
   -- Status Quo on requirements elicitation, documentation, validation, and management practices
   -- Current progblems experienced in RE and how these problems manifest themselves in the process
* The survey is anonymous, because we are especially interested in personal experiences and critical opinions.
* The focus of the questions is on experienced made in individual projetc environments. Redistribution of the survey invitation within organisations is therefore possible and highly appreciated.
* The overall initiative is run by the community for the community and, thus, all data will be curated and made publicly available after the data analysis.

We would highly appreciate your consideration and support!

Thanks and best regards,
The NaPiRE Team
