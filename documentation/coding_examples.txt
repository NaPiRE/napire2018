In an imaginary survey, respondents were asked for personal information.

List-supplementing short free text answers - Code Back Mode:

v_5 asks respondents to name favorite colors, and the options list included red, 
blue, pink, purple, etc., plus: Other (please specify).

Respondents 1 and 2 answered "Other (please specify)", their free text responses are 
"magenta" and "violet". Respondent 3 answered "it depends on my mood".
After your processing, the code file will look like this:

lfdn;v_5;tag
1;magenta;pink
2;violet;purple
3;it depends on my mood;NotCodeable

List-supplementing short free text answers - New Tags Mode:

v_2 asks respondents to specify their race; with the standard options available. 
A non-negligible number of respondents answered "Other (please specify)" and specified
variants of "Hobbit", "Elb", or "Ork", whereas others specified "Dunedain". 
You decide to group the Dunedain with the Caucasian Whites but add new 
codes for the inhabitants of the Shire and the like.
After your processing, your code file could look like this:

lfdn;v_2;tag
1;hobbit;Hobbit
2;Dunedain;Caucasian White
3;Elb;Elb

List-supplanting short free text answers (similar process for long free text answers):

v_7 asked respondents to list their skills, and no options were provided to choose from.
Having looked through the answers, you decide to design a small hierarchy of tags, 
differentiating, inter alia, between character traits and magic capabilities.
For respondent 4, you thus assign two tags:

lfdn;v_7;tag
4;"Going invisible; persistence";magic:invisibility
4;"Going invisible; persistence";character:persistence
