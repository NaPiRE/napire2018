    "* if we assign one of the suggested answers to a free text answer because we think it belongs there, we're - in a way - modifying the will of our respondent\n",
    "* if we create new codes, we don't know whether other respondents would have picked one of these codes instead of their original choice because they simply picked the most suitable of the presented choices (rather than being more precise in a free text answer)\n",
    "\n",
    "Against this background, one general suggestion could also be:\n",
    "* Use all 'Other (please specify)' answers (i.e., free text answers to list-supplementing questions) to improve future surveys only\n",
    "* Ignore the 'Other (please specify)' answers when 'blocking' on the variable in question\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow-up problem: \n",
    "* When searching for correlations between two variables with free text supplements, only respondents making list choices for *both* variables can be considered\n",
